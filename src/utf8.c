/*
 * @bad @todo
 * I think this is _technically_ incorrect code.
 * The issue is that we're taking a pointer to arbitrary
 * bytes in a string and casting the pointer into a yed_glyph*.
 * Then we dereference it.
 * Imagine that our pointer is pointing at the last byte of
 * some memory region.
 * When we cast, we're allowed to touch (and may be implicitly
 * touching) 3 extra bytes (yed_glyph is 4 bytes).
 * This probably won't introduce any problems because we're only
 * ever explicitly reading the first byte of this memory, but if
 * the compiler decides that it needs to touch the other three bytes,
 * then we might segfault.
 *
 * I'm going to leave it for now so that it'll be fast, but just be
 * aware that this could induce crashes.
 *

 *
 * UPDATE: A workaround for this issue is to make sure that the string
 * has at least 3 bytes of padding. This is implemented in
 * yed_fill_buff_from_file_map().
